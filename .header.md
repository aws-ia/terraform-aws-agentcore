# Bedrock AgentCore Module

The [Amazon Bedrock AgentCore](https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/agentcore/) Terraform module provides a high-level, object-oriented approach to creating and managing Amazon Bedrock AgentCore resources using Terraform. This module abstracts away the complexity of the L1 resources and provides a higher level implementation.

## Overview

The module provides support for Amazon Bedrock AgentCore Runtime and Runtime Endpoints. This allows you to deploy custom container-based runtimes for your Bedrock agents. You can extend agent capabilities with custom code that runs in your own container, giving you full control over the agent's behavior and integration capabilities.

This module simplifies the process of:

- Creating and configuring Bedrock AgentCore Runtimes
- Setting up AgentCore Runtime Endpoints
- Managing IAM permissions for your runtimes
- Configuring network access and security settings

## Features

- **Custom Container Support**: Deploy your own container images from Amazon ECR
- **Flexible Networking**: Support for both PUBLIC and VPC network modes
- **IAM Role Management**: Automatic creation of IAM roles with appropriate permissions
- **Environment Variables**: Pass configuration to your runtime container
- **JWT Authorization**: Optional JWT authorizer configuration for secure access
- **Endpoint Management**: Create and manage runtime endpoints for client access

## Usage

### Basic Runtime and Endpoint

```hcl
module "agentcore" {
  source  = "aws-ia/agentcore/aws"
  version = "0.0.1"

  # Enable Agent Core Runtime
  create_runtime = true
  runtime_name = "MyCustomRuntime"
  runtime_description = "Custom runtime for my Bedrock agent"
  runtime_container_uri = "123456789012.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/bedrock/agent-runtime:latest"
  runtime_network_mode = "PUBLIC"
  # Environment variables for the runtime
  runtime_environment_variables = {
    "LOG_LEVEL" = "INFO"
    "ENV" = "production"
  }
  # Enable Agent Core Runtime Endpoint
  create_runtime_endpoint = true
  runtime_endpoint_name = "MyRuntimeEndpoint"
  runtime_endpoint_description = "Endpoint for my custom runtime"
}
```

### With JWT Authorization

```hcl
module "agentcore" {
  source  = "aws-ia/agentcore/aws"
  version = "0.0.1"

  # Enable Agent Core Runtime
  create_runtime = true
  runtime_name = "SecureRuntime"
  runtime_container_uri = "123456789012.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/bedrock/agent-runtime:latest"

  # Configure JWT authorization
  runtime_authorizer_configuration = {
    custom_jwt_authorizer = {
      discovery_url = "https://cognito-idp.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/us-east-1_example/.well-known/jwks.json"
      allowed_audience = ["client-id-1", "client-id-2"]
    }
  }

  # Enable Agent Core Runtime Endpoint
  create_runtime_endpoint = true
  runtime_endpoint_name = "SecureEndpoint"
}
```

### With Custom IAM Role

```hcl
module "agentcore" {
  source  = "aws-ia/agentcore/aws"
  version = "0.0.1"

  # Enable Agent Core Runtime with custom IAM role
  create_runtime = true
  runtime_name = "CustomRoleRuntime"
  runtime_container_uri = "123456789012.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/bedrock/agent-runtime:latest"
  runtime_role_arn = "arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/my-custom-bedrock-role"

  # Enable Agent Core Runtime Endpoint
  create_runtime_endpoint = true
  runtime_endpoint_name = "CustomRoleEndpoint"
}
```

## Architecture

The module creates the following resources:

1. **Agent Core Runtime**: A container-based runtime environment for your Bedrock agent
2. **IAM Role and Policy**: Permissions for the runtime to access AWS services
3. **Agent Core Runtime Endpoint**: An endpoint for client applications to interact with the runtime

The IAM role includes permissions for:

- ECR image access
- CloudWatch Logs
- X-Ray tracing
- CloudWatch metrics
- Bedrock model invocation
- Workload identity token management

## Prerequisites

To use this module, you need:

1. An AWS account with appropriate permissions
2. Terraform >= 1.0.7
3. AWS provider >= 4.0.0
4. AWSCC provider >= 0.24.0
5. A container image in Amazon ECR (for the runtime)

## Examples

The module includes examples demonstrating different use cases:

### Agent Runtime with STRANDS Framework

The [agent-runtime](./examples/agent-runtime) example demonstrates:

- Creating an ECR repository
- Building and pushing a Docker image
- Creating a Bedrock Agent Runtime and Endpoint
- Implementing a STRANDS framework agent with tool-calling capabilities

This example includes:

- A Python implementation using the STRANDS framework
- Tools for calculations, weather information, and greetings
- Testing scripts for local and deployed testing

## Advanced Configuration

### Network Configuration

The module supports both PUBLIC and VPC network modes:

```hcl
# Public network mode (default)
runtime_network_mode = "PUBLIC"

# VPC network mode (requires additional configuration)
runtime_network_mode = "VPC"
```

### Environment Variables

Pass configuration to your runtime container:

```hcl
runtime_environment_variables = {
  "LOG_LEVEL" = "DEBUG"
  "MODEL_ID" = "anthropic.claude-3-sonnet-20240229-v1:0"
  "MAX_TOKENS" = "4096"
}
```

### Tags

Add tags to your resources:

```hcl
runtime_tags = {
  Environment = "production"
  Project     = "ai-assistants"
  Owner       = "data-science-team"
}

runtime_endpoint_tags = {
  Environment = "production"
  Project     = "ai-assistants"
  Owner       = "data-science-team"
}
```
